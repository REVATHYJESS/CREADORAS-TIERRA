#INTRODUCTION

Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

#OUR PROJECT

An event portal is a solution that lets people design, create, discover, catalog, share, visualize, secure, and manage events and event-driven applications. Through our project we just introduce the various features of an event portal in a simple way.When we login to our portal we can see two pages one is Admin and the other is Registration. 

.In the admin page we can notify the features like Add event, Delete event, User control. In the registration page we are able to see sign in page Or login  page. Through this we can get the details of the scheduled event, also we can book new tickets for our event by providing date, time, phone number and other details. We can identify our tickets through event option. 

#RELEVANCE OF PROJECT

Here this is a project which shows a new method of our needs.We are presenting our project about the creation of an event portal in our own college using simple python language which is very useful for our coming generation. 
A key benefit of using Event Portal is its ability to track the relationships that exist in an extremely decoupled event-driven architecture (EDA). It enables the reuse of schemas and events, and graphically presents the relationships that exist between applications and events.

#CONCLUSION

By using this python coding we just create a new way to achieve a new idea.Today in this present life we are making everything easier and more accessable through the developing technology.

This event portal  makes each event of our college more handable and manageable also a memorable for our life
